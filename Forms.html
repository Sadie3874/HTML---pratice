        the form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form must be put inside.
        the attribute that are required are name, id and method.

        name gives some descriptive information about what the form will be used for. id allows us it
        reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our code.

        id allows is to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our code.

        method has two tupical values: get and post. get is used for forms tar do not asl for peronal infomation(search bars,etc.).
        post is used for the forms that ask for the personal infomation (login and setup pages, elc.).

        the type attrubute defines the type of input. the name attrubute defines the variable name that would be used for the 
        input when the data gets passed to the server(requires back-end scripting which is beyond the scope of the course).
        the id attribute allows is to reference the input form the label and from other parts of our code.

        all inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the input using the input's id attribute.
        when an input is required, it is inportant to include the word required in the label's text.
