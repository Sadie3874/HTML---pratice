      <!--anchors are an example of inline elements becaise, by default, they only take up the space that they need  to.

    we showed the difference between block and inline elements using developer tools, which we accessed using Ctrl+Shift+I. 
    developer tools is a helpful to show you the exact code that is used to display a specific element
    and can show you the width,height and spaceing anrounf an element.
